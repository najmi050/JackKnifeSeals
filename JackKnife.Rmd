## Introduction
JackKnife is a re-sampling technique used for removing bias and statistical errors inherently present in the samples. In the presence of an unbiased sample, produces the same estimate as the original sample. It is a non-parametric method, and therefore free from all assumptions which are associated with the parametric method. It is mainly used for to reduce bias and to estimate variance for estimators such as variance and mean. It is used when the sample's underlying distribution is not discernible, the sample size is small and can also be used just as an alternative to the traditional methods. It uses a Leave-One-Out strategy, for making a large number of sub-samples from an original sample, giving us n samples each with n-1 data points. It doesn't perform well with non-smooth statistics such as median and non-linear statistics such correlation co-coefficients[1][2]

Although conceptually more complex, it is computationally less intensive than bootstrap, it produces estimates similar to bootstrap, except for the variance estimate, as it does not involve any randomness. To this end its estimates are always the same for a given original sample, unlike bootstrapping which gives different results each time its run.[3]

## Analytical and JackKnife Estimate Comparison for the Seals data
The Original sample's spread of data points can be seen by these two figures below (Figures 1 and 2). The Seal data set's box plot and histogram are indicative of a large variance. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Boxplot for body lengths of the originalseal's dataset.",fig.align='center', out.width = '50%'}

knitr::include_graphics("/Users/najmi/Desktop/Semester 2/ID5059/Original Boxplot.png")

```
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Histogram for body lengths of the original seal's dataset.",fig.align='center', out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/najmi/Desktop/Semester 2/ID5059/Original Histogram.png")
```

When we compare this to the JackKnife estimates of its replicates (Figures 3 and 4, box plot and histogram of means of its sub-samples) it shows that the variance in data has been reduced. This is because of the fact that by producing n replicates with n-1 samples each, JackKnife removes the bias in the variance estimate of the original data set. The original standard error of the mean lengths was 5.53, which is extremely large when compared to the JackKnife estimate, 0.55.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Box plot for JackKnife estimate sample means .",fig.align='center', out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/najmi/Desktop/Semester 2/ID5059/Jackknife Boxplot.png")
```
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Histogram for JackKnife estimated means for its 'n' samples or replicates.",fig.align='center', out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/najmi/Desktop/Semester 2/ID5059/Jackknife Histogram.png")
```

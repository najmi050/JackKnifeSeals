# Jack Knife on Seals dataset

JackKnife is a re-sampling technique used for removing bias and statistical errors inherently present in thesamples. In the presence of an unbiased sample, produces the same estimate as the original sample. It is anon-parametric method, and therefore free from all assumptions which are associated with the parametricmethod. It is mainly used for to reduce bias and to estimate variance for estimators such as variance andmean. It is used when the sample’s underlying distribution is not discernible, the sample size is small and canalso be used just as an alternative to the traditional methods. It uses a Leave-One-Out strategy, for makinga large number of sub-samples from an original sample, giving us n samples each with n-1 data points. It doesn’t perform well with non-smooth statistics such as median and non-linear statistics such correlation co-coefficients.
